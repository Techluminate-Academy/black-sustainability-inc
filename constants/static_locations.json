In my philanthropic work, I strive to connect Black, Indigenous, and other Global Majority communities with the tools and resources necessary to realize resource sovereignty and climate resilience.\n\nAs a descendant of Indigenous African stewards in Nigeria and Southern Black farmers in the Southeast U.S., I have witnessed firsthand the impacts of environmental degradation and industrial agriculture, which have displaced my family from the land they have harmonized with for generations. My pre-med studies at Stanford University deepened my understanding of how environmental harm exacerbates climate catastrophes and adversely affects the health and livelihoods of marginalized communities.\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford in 2021, I focused on climate change and environmental justice, particularly in the realms of permaculture, agroecology, and traditional Indigenous agricultural practices. My work aims to explore and promote these interconnected practices as powerful alternatives to the dominant modes of land and resource extraction that jeopardize our planet today.\n\nCurrently, as a Program Associate at the Waverley Street Foundation, I collaborate with our team and external partners to design and deliver grants focused on natural farming, renewable energy, and joy. I have also contributed significantly to shaping foundation strategies, especially around global youth activism and land-based liberation.\n\nI started Get Free Food to inspire and empower communities to reclaim their food sovereignty through joyous, culturally resonant gatherings. By collaborating with local farmers, chefs, artists, community orgs, and educators, we ensure that everyone has access to healthy, free food while fostering a sense of belonging and regeneration. We envision a food movement where everyone can find belonging ‚Äî place by place, moment by moment, meal by meal. We must make the good food revolution irresistible.\n\nMy passion for Black and Indigenous liberation, climate justice, and youth education is complemented by my interests in poetry, food and land sovereignty, revolutionary aesthetics, and Afrofuturism. I continue to engage in intergenerational, intersectional, and international efforts to build just resource systems, reinvigorate sovereignty, and create sanctuaries for marginalized communities.",
